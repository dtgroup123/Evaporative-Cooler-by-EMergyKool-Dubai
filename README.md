Dubai is a fast-growing economy with most of its land as a desert. Its climate always stays above the 45-degree Celsius mark. The country spends a large amount on funding on cooling and electricity. Adopting energy efficient technologies such as the Evaporative Cooling technology is one of the important decisions by the government to cut expenditures. Also, air-conditioners are not suitable to cool large indoor area and outdoor areas. Outdoor areas must be cooled with the help of misting system or evaporative cooling system. The same applies to the neighboring countries such as Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Lebanon and Jordan. Use of this technology also helps in reducing the global warming and the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases spoil the Ozone layer, which speeds up the process of global warming. &lt;br> About the author Evaporative Coolers and Evaporative Cooling Systems are recognized to be the most competitive outdoor cooling solutions in Dubai, UAE. www.emergykool.com  www.emergykool.com/cooling-system.php
